== 0.10.0 released 2008-10-24

* Do not allow instantiation if the session has not been activated with a controller object. Just like ActiveRecord won't let you do anything without a DB connection.
* Abstracted controller implementation to allow for rails, merb, etc adapters. So this is not confined to the rails framework.
* Removed create and update methods and added save, like ActiveRecord.
* after_validation should be able to change the result if it adds errors on callbacks.
* Completed tests.

== 0.9.1 released 2008-10-24

* Changed scope to id. Makes more sense to call it an id and fits better with the ActiveRecord model.
* Removed saving_from_session flag, apparently it is not needed.
* Fixed updating sessions to make more sense and be stricter.
* change last_click_at to last_request_at
* Only run "after" callbacks if the result is successful.
